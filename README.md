# Class-Projects
Projects I've completed and compiled for core classes. Below is a list of classes and their short descriptions:

1. CS 539, Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks **(Python)** -> Covers the theory and applications of artifical neural networks using Pytorch/TensorFlow. Topics include MLP, CNN, DNN, and SNM.
2. CS 320, Data Science Programming II **(Python)** -> Data Science programming must-haves, like data structures and hands-on experience with libraries such as sklearn, pandas, Selenium, etc.
3. CS 577, Algorithms **(Java, Python)** -> Implementations of many classic algo problems such as the Knapsack problem, Stable Marriage problem, etc.
4. CS 400, Data Structures II **(Java)** -> Deep dive into data structures such as Hash Tables, BSTs, graphs, graph traversal algorithms, etc. Each project is student-designed from ideation to implementation.
5. Stat 340, Data Science Modeling II **(R)** -> Applying statistical methods to learn from data. Teaches Bayesian inference and associated probability theory; linear and logistic regression models; the bootstrap; and cross-validation.
6. CS 354, Machine Organization and Programming **(C)** -> Projects relating to the fundamental structure of computer systems. Topics include heap and dynamic memory management, communication and interrupts/signals, etc.
7. CS 300, Data Structures I **(Java)** -> Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and the usage of interfaces, generics, and data structures.
8. Stat 240, Data Science Modeling I **(R)** -> Covers topics such as data wrangling, data graphics and visualization, data modeling, random variables and concepts of probability
